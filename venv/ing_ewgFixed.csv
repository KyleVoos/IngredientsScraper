6.5|252|Isobutylparaben is in the parabens family of preservatives used by the food, pharmaceutical, and personal care product industries. Parabens mimic estrogen, are potential hormone (endocrine) system disruptors, and were found in the breast cancer tumors of 19 of 20 women studied (Darbre 2004). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tested urine from a group of 2,548 Americans over the age of 6 and found parabens in over 99% of samples (Calafat 2010). Isobutylparaben is closely related to butylparaben, a compound considered to be a potential human endocrine system disruptor by the European Commission on Endocrine Disruption (EU 2007). Isobutylparaben appears to be more strongly estrogenic than butylparaben (Darbre 2002, Vo 2010), but receives a lower hazard score in Skin Deep because of the limited amount of toxicological research on this chemical. Subsequent research and agency assessments may find isobutylparaben to be as or more hazardous to the endocrine system than butylparaben.|preservative|703160-ISOBUTYLPARABEN/

5.5|840|Isopropylparaben is in the parabens family of preservatives used by the food, pharmaceutical, and personal care product industries. Parabens mimic estrogen, are potential hormone (endocrine) system disruptors, and were found in the breast cancer tumors of 19 of 20 women studied (Darbre 2004). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tested urine from a group of 2,548 Americans over the age of 6 and found parabens in over 99% of samples (Calafat 2010). Isopropylparaben is closely related to propylparaben, a compound considered to be a potential human endocrine system disruptor by the European Commission on Endocrine Disruption (EU 2007). Isopropylparaben appears to be more strongly estrogenic than propylparaben (Vo 2010), but receives a lower hazard score in Skin Deep because of the limited amount of toxicological research on this chemical. Subsequent research and agency assessments may find isopropylparaben to be as or more hazardous to the endocrine system than propylparaben.|preservative|703212-ISOPROPYLPARABEN/

4|2943|Formaldehyde is a carcinogenic impurity released by a number of cosmetic preservatives, including diazolidinyl urea, imidazolidinyl urea, DMDM hydantoin, quaternium-15, 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol, and sodium hydroxylmethylglycinate. According to reviews by the industry-funded Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel, these cosmetic ingredients can release formaldehyde at levels as high as one-tenth that of the original ingredient (CIR 2006). Successful treatment of formaldehyde-triggered contact allergic dermatitis through substitution of body care products free of these preservatives (Flyvholm 1992) is implicit confirmation of the presence of low levels of formaldehyde in these products. The International Agency for Research on Carcinogens (IARC) has classified formaldehyde as 'carcinogenic to humans,' and the U.S. National Toxicology Program has classified it as 'reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen,' based on emerging evidence in humans and robust evidence in animals (IARC 2004; NTP 2005). Occupational exposures to formaldehyde gas are linked to nasal and nasopharyngeal cancers (IARC 2004; NTP 2005). Animal studies confirm this link, and also suggest an association between formaldehyde in drinking water and stomach and gastrointestinal cancer and leukemia (NTP 2005). Despite the considerable health concerns associated with this carcinogen, until recently formaldehyde itself was a common ingredient of nail polish. Consumer pressure has now forced many major cosmetics manufacturers to voluntarily remove this ingredient from their nail products. European health protections now limit the concentration of formaldehyde in cosmetics to 0.2%, and require that body care products containing formaldehyde or formaldehyde-releasing ingredients be labeled with the warning 'contains formaldehyde' if the concentration of formaldehyde in the product exceeds 0.05% (SCCPNP 2002). Even the industry-funded Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel recommends that cosmetic products not contain more than 0.2% formaldehyde, and does not consider formaldehyde to be safe in aerosol products (CIR 2006). However, as it stands in the U.S. there are no restrictions on the levels of formaldehyde allowed in any body care products, no requirement to test products made with formaldehyde-releasing preservatives for levels of formaldehyde, and certainly no obligation to inform consumers that the products they use each day are likely to contain a cancer-causing chemical that does not appear on the list of ingredients.

3|8524|This ingredient is derived from the placenta, an organ that develops in female mammals during pregnancy, lining the uterine wall and attached by the umbilical cord to provide nourishment and oxygen to the fetus. The placenta produces progesterone, estrogen, and other hormones, which raise potential health concerns in personal care products. In one study four girls between one and eight years of age developed breasts or pubic hair two to 24 months after starting the use of estrogen- or placenta-containing hair products. Their breasts and public hair regressed when they stopped using the products. No other cause for early sexual development was found.

6.5|8898|The carcinogen 1,4-dioxane contaminates up to 46% of personal care products tested (OCA 2008, EWG 2008). The chemical is an unwanted byproduct of an ingredient processing method called ethoxylation used to reduce the risk of skin irritation for petroleum-based ingredients. Though 1,4-dioxane can easily be removed from products before they are sold, its widespread presence in products indicates that many manufacturers fail to take this simple step. In 2001, FDA scientists detected the carcinogenic impurity 1,4-dioxane at levels up to 1410 parts per million (ppm) in cosmetic raw materials, and at levels up to 279 ppm in personal care products (Black 2001). Testing data suggested significant cause for concern: 'Levels of 1,4-dioxane in excess of 85 ppm in children's shampoos indicate that continued monitoring of raw materials and finished products is warranted' (Black 2001). The federal agency responsible for the safety of consumer goods, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), agreed that the presence of 1,4- dioxane, even as a trace contaminant, is cause for concern (NTP 2005). The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) has found that many products on the market today contain 1,4-dioxane, and some body care products may contain 1,4-dioxane at levels higher than recommended by FDA for other types of products (ATSDR 2007). ATSDR recommends limiting childrenâ€™s exposure to consumer products that may contain this carcinogenic impurity: Families wishing to avoid cosmetics containing the ingredients listed above may do so by reviewing the ingredient statement that is required to appear on the outer container label of cosmetics offered for retail sale. Also, families may look for cautionary statements on the labels of foaming detergent bath products with directions for safe use, the need to keep out of the reach of children, or the need for adult supervision. â€” ATSDR 2007 A consumer can identify products that may contain 1,4-dioxane by scanning ingredient lists for the common ingredients that may contain the impurity, identifiable by the prefix or designations of 'PEG,' 'â€“ethâ€“,' 'Polyethylene,' 'Polyethylene glycol' 'Polyoxyethylene,' or 'â€“oxynolâ€“' (FDA 2007). The U.S. National Toxicology Program has concluded that 1,4-dioxane is 'reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen' based on numerous animal studies (NTP 2005). IARC classifies 1,4-dioxane as 'possibly carcinogenic to humans' (IARC 1999), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers 1,4-dioxane a probable human carcinogen (EPA 2003). Exposures to this impurity are linked to tumors of the liver, gallbladder, nasal cavity, lung, skin, and breast (IARC 1999; NTP 2005). Presence of 1,4-dioxane in cosmetics is of special concern, since it can be absorbed through the skin in toxic amounts. In a review conducted in 1982, the industry-funded Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel noted that the cosmetic industry was aware of the problem of 1,4-dioxane in cosmetics and was making an effort to reduce or remove the impurity (CIR 2006). But decades later, FDA expresses continuing concerns about 1,4-dioxane, noting its potential to contaminate a wide range of products, and its ready penetration through the skin (FDA 2007). FDA notes that 1,4-dioxane can be removed 'by means of vacuum stripping at the end of the polymerization process without an unreasonable increase in raw material cost' (FDA 2007), but such treatment would be voluntary on the part of industry. It is clear from an examination of ingredient assessments published by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review that this industry panel routinely approves ingredients in the absence of impurity data. In a review of a large class of ingredients called ceteareths, for example, the panel stressed 'the importance of purification procedures to remove... impurities' noting that '...in the absence of impurities data, the Panel caution[s] that a Ceteareth preparation should not contain 1,4-dioxane or ethylene oxide which are possible oxidation products' (CIR 2006). FDA exhibits the same toothless concern regarding 1,4-dioxane in body care products, refusing to establish purity standards for this carcinogen despite awareness of broad-scale contamination.
